# Background

A two day event for students and early career digital artists to seek out ways of creatively navigating the history of the Hallé. A chance to mine and extract data that uncovers the untold stories and histories from within the Hallé’s archive.

The Hallé holds a 165 year history of the musical organisation, including a newly searchable online database containing over 40,000 listings of individual works, artists, soloists, concert halls and much more from 1858 to 1990.

The Hallé Hackathon is a great opportunity, over two days, to test out creative ideas, learn new skills and meet like-minded individuals. You might even win a prize at the end!
We are looking for teams of people to use linked data, AI and other tools to explore themes of *culture and identity* (gender and ethnicity of performers, conductors, soloists, composers), *space and place* (locations of performances, concert halls, tours), and *time and style* (exploring the effects of time on the compositions and performances performed by the orchestra).
